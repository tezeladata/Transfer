# What if we want to calculate the probability that two events happen simultaneously? For two events, A and B, this is P(A and B) or the probability of the intersection of A and B.

# When two evenets are dependent on each other:
# P (A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A)

# When two events are independent from each other:
# P (A and B) = P(A) * P(B)


# Tree diagrams have the following properties:

# Each branch represents a specific set of events.
# The probabilities the terminal branches (all possible sets of outcomes) sum to one.
# We multiply across branches (using the multiplication rule!) to calculate the probability that each branch (set of outcomes) will occur.


# For probabilities, we can use Bayes theorem:
# P (B | A) = (P(A | B) * P(B)) / P(A)

# Now let's use that formula for step throat
# P (ST | +) = (P(+ | ST) * P(ST)) / P(+)
# What we know:
# P(+ | ST) = .85
# P(ST) = = .20
# P(+) = .186

# P(St | + ) = (.85 * .2) / .186 = .913
