1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
What it does: HTTP is the protocol used by web browsers and servers to communicate. It allows you to load websites, send form data, or retrieve information from the internet.
Example: When you type www.example.com in your browser, HTTP handles the request to fetch the webpage.

2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
What it does: TCP is like the delivery system for data on the internet. It ensures that all parts of your data (like a webpage or a file) are sent and received correctly, in the right order.
Example: When you download a file, TCP makes sure every part of the file arrives at your device and reassembles it properly.

3. TLS (Transport Layer Security)
What it does: TLS encrypts data to keep it secure during transmission over the internet. This ensures that sensitive information, like passwords and credit card numbers, can't be intercepted.
Example: When you see https:// in a website URL (with the "s"), it means TLS is being used to secure your connection.

In short:
HTTP is for communication.
TCP ensures reliable delivery.
TLS makes it secure.
