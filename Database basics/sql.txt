A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations.

All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type. Some of the most common data types are:
INTEGER, a positive or negative whole number
TEXT, a text string
DATE, the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
REAL, a decimal value

A statement is text that the database recognizes as a valid command. Statements always end in a semicolon ;.

CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type, 
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);

CREATE statements allow us to create a new table in the database. You can use the CREATE statement anytime you want to create a new table from scratch. 

The INSERT statement inserts a new row into a table.
We can use the INSERT statement when you want to add new records:
INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age) 
VALUES (1, 'Justin Bieber', 29);

SELECT statements are used to fetch data from a database.

The ALTER TABLE statement adds a new column to a table. You can use this command when you want to add columns to a table. The statement below adds a new column twitter_handle to the celebs table:
ALTER TABLE celebs 
ADD COLUMN twitter_handle TEXT;

The UPDATE statement edits a row in a table. You can use the UPDATE statement when you want to change existing records. The statement below updates the record with an id value of 4 to have the twitter_handle @taylorswift13:
UPDATE celebs 
SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13' 
WHERE id = 4; 

The DELETE FROM statement deletes one or more rows from a table. You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records. The statement below deletes all records in the celebs table with no twitter_handle:
DELETE FROM celebs 
WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;

They can be used to tell the database to reject inserted data that does not adhere to a certain restriction. The statement below sets constraints on the celebs table.
CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
   name TEXT UNIQUE,
   date_of_birth TEXT NOT NULL,
   date_of_death TEXT DEFAULT 'Not Applicable'
);
